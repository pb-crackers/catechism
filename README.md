# Catechism ✝️
A repository that contains the scripts for vectorizing the Catechism in a Supabase DB and a LangGraph agent that queries that database to find relevant answers.

# Overview
This repository began as an effort to be able to query and find answers about the Catholic church faster than googling and with a definitive source -- the Catechsim itself.

Answers provided are directly pulled from the Catechism itself and the underlying models are not allowed to edit the information. This is effectively a super search for the Catechism to find all of the most relevant sections based on the semantic meaning of the query.
